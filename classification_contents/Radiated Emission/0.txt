11. RE-test

11. re-test reference standard: gb18655－2002（cispr25） limits and methods of measurement of radio disturbance characteristics for the protection of receivers used on board vehicles 11.1. test objective used to test the electromagnetic energy radiated by electronic/electrical components that are working properly 11.2. test method overall layout of the interference source and wiring harness copy standardized test conditions. if the length of wiring harness and standard length of harness for test have a little difference, it should be approved and recorded on the test report. wiring harness (including power leads and control / signal lines) should be supported by the insulating material to 50mm above the ground, and harness should be arranged in straight. dut should work with typical load and
16 under other conditions same as entire car, so as to get the maximum emission. these working conditions should be decided and interpreted in the test plan, so that the suppliers and customers are able to perform exactly the same test. dut whose power supply loop-line are remotely grounded: two artificial networks are needed, one for positive power line, one for loop-line of power supply. dut whose power supply loop-line is closely grounded: one artificial network is needed for positive power line. measurement port of artificial networks should be connected to a load of 50ω, the surface of the greatest interference source of radio emission should be closest to antenna. the surface changes with the frequency, and the measurement are performed on 2 plane perpendicular to each other. the maximum level at every frequency point should be recorded in the test report. for the measurement at frequencies above 30mhz, antenna should be directed in the horizontal and vertical polarization direction so that the receiver receives the maximum rf noise level. distance of the wiring harness and antenna should be 1000mm±10mm. this distance is from center point of wiring harness to: vertical monopole antenna; center of biconical antenna; closest approach of log periodic antenna dut should be placed 100 mm±10 mm near the edge of test-bed, as in the figure. if the spectrum analyzer is used to measure peak value, the video bandwidth should be at least 3 times the resolution bandwidth. the test should be performed in required frequency range with the antenna in the vertical and horizontal polarization direction respectively.

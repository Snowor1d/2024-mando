16.Radiation Immunity test (ALSE-test)

16. radiation immunity test (alse-test) reference standard: iso11452-2 road vehicles -- component test methods for electrical disturbances from narrowband radiated electromagnetic energy -- part 2: absorber-lined shielded enclosure 16.1. test method in this test method, dut is exposed to electromagnetic radiation generated by the antenna. dut and its wiring harness should be placed at 50mm±5mm on a woody or equivalent non-conductive table. earth plate should be metal and thicker than 0.5mm. minimum size of earth plate depends on the size of the dut, and there should be enough room for wiring harness and components. earth plate should be connected to protective conductor of earthed system. earth plate should be 1.0m±0.1m above the ground of laboratory and parallel to the ground. all the power supply of dut needs to be connected with lisn. when the distance from power cord of dut is bigger than 2000mm, lisn should be connected between positive and negative poles. when the distance from power cord of dut is smaller than 2000mm, lisn need to be connected to positive poles of power supply only. the length of power cord should not 2000mm, the definition of its length can be decided according to the placement of power supply of the system. phase center of radiating antenna should be placed 100mm±0.1m above the ground of test room, and at a distance of 1000mm±0.1mm from power connection wire, test layout is shown in figure 18.

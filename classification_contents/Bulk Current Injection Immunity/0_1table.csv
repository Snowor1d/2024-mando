a),Pre-calibration should be performed depending on the limits selected for interfering signals
,generated from signal generator and power amplifier;
b),"Monitoring probe should be placed 50mm from DUT connector, current injection probe"
,should be placed at a distance of 50mm from monitoring probe.
c),"In frequency range of 10kHz - 400MHz, signal modulation of 1kHz and 50% dutyfactor"
,should be applied to the signal generator.
d),"Applied disturbance to the related cable of DUT, and monitor whether the DUT is disturbed"

9. AN-test

9. an-test reference standard: iso 7637-2 road vehicles -- electrical disturbances from conduction and coupling -- part 2: electrical transient conduction along supply lines only 9.1. test methods from the principle, dut has three different types of joints: —dut has a long earth wire; (on a vehicle, dut can be freely assigned to any point on the ground connection with cable bundle) —dut with a short ground wire; (on a vehicle, dut can use a short ( <=250mm) lead sheathed cable to connected to the car body, and tightened with the screws) —dut is a generator. the following are plane location sketches of each kind of dut, they are from cispr 25 3.0

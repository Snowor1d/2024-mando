14.Test of change rate of transient voltage / current (SR-test)

14. test of change rate of transient voltage / current (sr-test) 14.1. test method test can be performed in non-shielded room, and use an oscilloscope to test directly from the pin of unit under test 14.1.1. voltage test bandwidth of voltage probe for test should not be less than 500mhz, and test directly from 2 ends
25 of component, layout of test is in figure 12. figure 12 voltage test 14.1.2. current test test should be performed as much close to the unit under test as possible, when current ≤2a, current probe is 1:1 or 1:10. when current is less than 2a, closed-loop test method can be used; when current is greater than 2a, current probe method can be used. figure 13 current test(i≤2a)26 figure 14 current test (i>2a) 14.2. technical requirements change rate of voltage/current of every dut’s pin needs to be tested. change rate of voltage / current is between 20% and 80%, detailed technical requirements are in table 8: table 8 technical requirements of change rate of voltage / current classification voltage change ratio (dv/dt) current change ratio (di/dt) requirements 1 du/dt ≤ 200mv/µs di/dt ≤ 20ma/µs qualified 2 0.2v/µs < du/dt ≤ 10v/µs 20ma/µs < di/dt ≤ 100ma/µs risky, need to add protection 3 du/dt > 10v/µs du/dt > 100ma/µs not qualified note: when close to antenna to other sensitive devices, protective measures need to be taken for the sensitive devices; generally common in control elements, such kind of signal is inevitable, corresponding measures need to be taken for the sensitive devices.
